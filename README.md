# 2DPixelPlatformer
This project is one of my dreams and one that I have always loved. To develop a storytelling-style role-playing game.

I'm at present working on this project to learn how the camera functions and how the character moves smoothly like in other platformer games, such as Dead Cell, Blasphemous, and Ori and the Blind Forest. 

However, I believe I'll put this project on hold for the time being in order to hone my game design abilities in areas like level design, enemy system, and core game.
